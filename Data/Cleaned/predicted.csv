With that said, there is a huge problem with your pricing system which leaves the drivers frustrated. Once a driver refused to get to my pickup point (by staying still) so that he can force me to cancel the trip and take responsibility off of him (since I was new to the app I did not know then that my driver could be changed after cancelling the trip), and as I am writing this review three drivers rejected my trip again before I decided to use another trip option, which was more costly. I‚Äôm of the opinion that the drivers don‚Äôt like the fare which is too little, and that may lead to harassment cases in future.

I would also recommend on Uber introducing tutorials on how to cancel a trip and the options available for it, so that riders may have the peace of mind of knowing that they may not have to pay damages for incidents which are not their fault.
