This situation is unacceptable and needs to be corrected. I am deeply disappointed by the driver’s unprofessional behaviour and even more so that the trip was billed to the corporate account. I explained to the driver that our office policy does not permit using the expressway at that time, but he insisted and ultimately asked me to exit the vehicle.

bgm_reviewer,3,2024-06-10,"This app has helped me travel faster and in more convenience at an affordable price, especially in my country where even hailing a cab can be a hassle and a security risk. 

With that said, there is a huge problem with your pricing system which leaves the drivers frustrated. Once a driver refused to get to my pickup point (by staying still) so that he can force me to cancel the trip and take responsibility off of him (since I was new to the app I did not know then that my driver could be changed after cancelling the trip), and as I am writing this review three drivers rejected my trip again before I decided to use another trip option, which was more costly. I’m of the opinion that the drivers don’t like the fare which is too little, and that may lead to harassment cases in future.

I would also recommend on Uber introducing tutorials on how to cancel a trip and the options available for it, so that riders may have the peace of mind of knowing that they may not have to pay damages for incidents which are not their fault. Thank you.",app_store,uber,False

UBER will tell you a ride is 15 minutes away; take 10 minutes looking for the ride and then tell you the ride is unavailable. ( The whole time the system lies that a ride is 15 minutes away) 

Pathetic app really; would not recommend it for developing countries. The vexes are not worth channeling your money to feed the foreign owned business. You’d rather the funds circulated in your local economy to improve your local transport infrastructure and sustain local developers with transport solutions.

Just give me a reason why i should not pay. You should update your app to give room for reason of cancellation. This was not my fault but the drivers. I then ordered another ride which the driver never attempted to contact me and i was totally in the dark. He also kept me waiting for 12 mins and i could also see him in the app just hovering around. Finally he was at Nairobi South B Estate parked which he still at till now as per the app on my phone. I called his contact which came to your support office and good enough the support team called me like 2 mins later. I lodged my compliant and the guy at support was cooperative. All he could do was ti cancel the trip and request that i reorder. My data bundles were by now over and i decided to walk since i did not want to be the one to cancel that trip. When i got home i saw msg from support team but i do not want to cancel it myself. Infact both your drivers are the ones to compensate me for very poor services and customer care. As at now i am not able to make any request and i would wish you clear even the msg from your support team and my request to you is that you should allow space in the app for complaints and cancellations with reason before you jump into compensation of drivers.

Martin Muriithi,1,2023-12-10,"Maybe I should begin by pointing out that I reside in Kenya, and Bolt’s reputation has been tainted. I thought it was a hoax until I had a bad experience with a driver myself. On three different occasions.

(a) So on occasion I booked a ride, and the driver showed up in a different vehicle from what is indicated on the app, and also ended the trip before reaching the destination for some nonsensical reason. Very rude as well. 

(b) After I booked a ride, a driver called and asked where I was going, then he ended up telling me he can’t take me there at that price. He literally told me to use another app 😨

(c) Another driver also called and asked how much is price is indicated on my phone for the trip. Literally asked me to pay more.

My advice to anyone would be to avoid paying these Kenyan drivers in cash. Rather, pay using a card. That way you won’t get into heated arguments when they ask you to pay more. Also the management should take such misconduct seriously. Charges are between the user and Bolt, not the driver and user.",app_store,bolt,False

I reported the issue to bolt and they advised me to go to a police station and send them a picture of the OB number. They later called and said they’ll direct the guy to the station which they never did few days later they asked me to go ask the investigating officer to send and email and I told them I’m currently out of town. The guy had broken my iphone and ran drove away with my 1000kes that I had paid prior since he wanted to pass by a petrol station and ask for loose change.

I started hitting his head with my phone until he stopped driving and I was screaming, so people gathered around, and he had the audacity to say he was only fighting me because I had refused to pay him, which was a lie.

at me and kept telling me how my people(Somalis)
are mean and rude and how he wishes honorable Ruto would deport us back to our country the whole ride.

lennzzyy,1,2017-06-05,Well to be honest this app This not as good as I thought it gave me an estimate of KSH of 461-611 then at the end of my trip it had doubled to KSH 1410. What is this honestly you're over charging for no valid reason 🙄 be honest with your customers. I'm so angry for such a thing that has happened it has never happened when I was using other services 😓😓. Plus the driver didn't even talk the whole way through. It was such a boring ride home🙄,app_store,bolt,False
