With that said, there is a huge problem with your pricing system which leaves the drivers frustrated.

I‚Äôm of the opinion that the drivers don‚Äôt like the fare which is too little, and that may lead to harassment cases in future.

I would also recommend on Uber introducing tutorials on how to cancel a trip and the options available for it, so that riders may have the peace of mind of knowing that they may not have to pay damages for incidents which are not their fault.

Just give me a reason why i should not pay. You should update your app to give room for reason of cancellation. This was not my fault but the drivers. I then ordered another ride which the driver never attempted to contact me and i was totally in the dark. He also kept me waiting for 12 mins and i could also see him in the app just hovering around. Finally he was at Nairobi South B Estate parked which he still at till now as per the app on my phone. I called his contact which came to your support office and good enough the support team called me like 2 mins later. I lodged my compliant and the guy at support was cooperative. All he could do was ti cancel the trip and request that i reorder. My data bundles were by now over and i decided to walk since i did not want to be the one to cancel that trip. When i got home i saw msg from support team but i do not want to cancel it myself. Infact both your drivers are the ones to compensate me for very poor services and customer care. As at now i am not able to make any request and i would wish you clear even the msg from your support team and my request to you is that you should allow space in the app for complaints and cancellations with reason before you jump into compensation of drivers.

(c) Another driver also called and asked how much is price is indicated on my phone for the trip. Literally asked me to pay more.

I got in the car and he started to drive. At some point he started telling me ma‚Äôam do you know since we‚Äôre going to use the expressway you‚Äôre gonna pay double for your ride. I told him I wasn‚Äôt gonna pay double because the app told me I was paying 500. I told him but if the app changes the price and tells me now I have to add to price I would be willing to accept. He started basically shouting 
at me and kept telling me how my people(Somalis)
are mean and rude and how he wishes honorable Ruto would deport us back to our country the whole ride. When we reached the location I was heading he told me I had to pay him 1000shillings even though the app from his phone and from my phone kept showing I should pay him 500.

4,"Most of the time Bolt works for me. However, there are three issues you need to address. Some Bolt drivers insist on cash and request riders to cancel and pay them offline in cash. I consider this to be unethical behaviour. The other issue is requesting for a Bolt Plus and you get a normal tiny car which beats the purpose of classification. Lastly, some drivers come with different cars other than those registered and plead that you should not report them. You need to deal with these issues.",Davnkyi,Observation,2020-06-09 10:41:05-07:00,bolt

1,Today I have deleted my account with taxify. I requested a cab with them. The cab accepted my trip request and then 2 minutes later I received a notification stating that I was charged for a trip I did not take. Taxify must have a tone of complaints because it took me 10mns to get their Kenya number. At which point their staff member decided to laugh at me and tell me relax. I am yet to receive my refund from this firm. Please note people DO NOT use taxify. It's a firm with little to no morals. Stick with uber or other providers.,iamkaceri,Taxify steal your money and have rude staff,2017-07-27 03:09:49-07:00,bolt

1,Well to be honest this app This not as good as I thought it gave me an estimate of KSH of 461-611 then at the end of my trip it had doubled to KSH 1410. What is this honestly you're over charging for no valid reason üôÑ be honest with your customers. I'm so angry for such a thing that has happened it has never happened when I was using other services üòìüòì. Plus the driver didn't even talk the whole way through. It was such a boring ride homeüôÑ,lennzzyy,Don't like the trip at all,2017-06-05 07:24:02-07:00,bolt
