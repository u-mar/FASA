Wanji,5,3 days ago,"I remember I have used Faras several times, and I promise I have never regretted it. I relocated to start a life when I moved out of my parents' house, and I never regretted it. The customer service was exemplary. The second most remarkable time was when my sister was being admitted to a boarding school. It was a great experience. The customer service is something I have always recalled anytime I think of getting a ride.",#N/A,faras

Yuehua Yang,1,a month ago,"The boda driver wanted to charge me more and I didn’t agree so he left without ending the trip. I have to call him and report to the safety center to end the trip and he reported I didn’t pay him even I didn’t take his boda at all.
While the Uber costumer care has no response for almost 24 hrs and then resolved my issues with no more way appealing. I still need to pay 130Ksh for the ride.
Worst customer service ever and they don’t care about anything apart from counting money.",#N/A,uber
Anyika marenga,1,a month ago,I have proof that i paid for my trip but the driver decided to indicate that i hadnt. This is frustrating because each time i try to request for a ride i end up being forced to pay for a trip that i already paid for via mpesa. Support is unavailable.  I will just have to uninstall the app because i cant deal with unscrupulous drivers who want to take advantage and a business that does not support clients complaints.,#N/A,uber
RaMoS S,1,2 months ago,"One pathetic app. Had a rider deliver food on Uber eats, paid him via mpesa (have the message to prove it) and, since the unscrupulous guy decided to keep the payment, I now have a pending payment that Uber will do nothing to resolve. Having lodged various complaints via their absolutely useless bot assistance and no resolution in sight and since they've decided to disable both, Uber ride AND eats until payment is submitted, I'm uninstalling the app as it is basically worthless having to fight for a mess up at their end.

Honestly, if I could give Uber negative stars, I would. So disappointing.",#N/A,uber

Vivian Akinyi,1,5 months ago,"I was charged for a trip that didn’t take place. The driver asked me to leave his car because I declined to use the expressway. As a result, I had to request another ride to reach my destination, yet the previous trip has been charged to our corporate account.

This situation is unacceptable and needs to be corrected. I am deeply disappointed by the driver’s unprofessional behaviour and even more so that the trip was billed to the corporate account. I explained to the driver that our office policy does not permit using the expressway at that time, but he insisted and ultimately asked me to exit the vehicle.
