## üìà Business Understanding

The ride-hailing market in Kenya is highly competitive, with companies like Uber, Bolt, Little Cab, and Faras all vying for market share. Understanding **customer sentiment** can reveal pain points and strengths that affect customer loyalty and app retention.

**This project aims to:**
- Identify what aspects customers care most about (e.g., price, driver behavior, app reliability).
- Benchmark Faras against its competitors using real user feedback.
- Enable data-driven product and marketing decisions through sentiment trends.
- Monitor public perception over time to assess impact of feature rollouts or service changes.

> With these insights, Faras can gain a **competitive edge** by addressing customer concerns faster and more strategically.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Pipeline Architecture
![Pipeline Architecture](Data/images/pipeline.png)
## üß† Modeling

We used powerful pretrained models from ü§ó [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) to analyze customer reviews:

### üîç Models Used

- **Zero-shot Classification**  
  [`facebook/bart-large-mnli`](https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large-mnli)  
  ‚Üí Detects custom topics like "pricing", "support", or "app issues".

- **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)**  
  [`yangheng/deberta-v3-base-absa-v1.1`](https://huggingface.co/yangheng/deberta-v3-base-absa-v1.1)  
  ‚Üí Finds sentiment for specific aspects like driver behavior or app performance.

- **General Sentiment Analysis**  
  [`cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment`](https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment)  
  ‚Üí Classifies reviews as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

- **Emotion Detection**  
  [`SamLowe/roberta-base-go_emotions`](https://huggingface.co/SamLowe/roberta-base-go_emotions)  
  ‚Üí Detects emotions like Joy, Anger, Sadness, etc.

Each model is used via the `pipeline()` method from the `transformers` library for easy integration.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

self.zero_shot = pipeline("zero-shot-classification", model="facebook/bart-large-mnli")
self.absa = pipeline("text-classification", model="yangheng/deberta-v3-base-absa-v1.1")
self.sentiment = pipeline("text-classification", model="cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment")
self.emotion = pipeline("text-classification", model="SamLowe/roberta-base-go_emotions")
```
